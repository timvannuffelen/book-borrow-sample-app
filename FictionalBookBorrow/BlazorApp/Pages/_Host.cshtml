    Mode "ServerPrerendered" serves pages faster than mode "Server"", but to get that better performance pages/components are rendered
    twice. This means the Blazor lifecycle methods like OnInitialized are also executed twice, which is not always desirable (for instance
    when we don't want to execute a round trip to the database twice, or when we load a random teaser image after a page refresh we don't
    want to generate two random images). Render mode "Server" decreases the performance of your app somewhat, but pages/components are
    only rendered once and thus lifecycle methods like OnInitialized are also executed only once.
